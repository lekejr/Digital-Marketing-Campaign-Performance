The objective of this analysis is to:
- Evaluate the return on marketing investments across campaign types and tiers  
- Identify the most effective marketing categories and platforms  
- Understand customer behavior trends and engagement patterns  
- Provide actionable insights for future campaign planning and budgeting

## Dataset Overview

The dataset comprises aggregated metrics related to multiple marketing campaigns, segmented by:
- Campaign Names  
- Categories (e.g. influencer, social, media, search)  
- Geo-Tiers (Tier 1, Tier 2 and Unknown)  
- Revenue Generated

## Methodology

1. **Metric Aggregation**: Calculated performance indicators (e.g. ROMI, CPC, CTR) for each campaign and category.  
2. **Segmentation**: Grouped data by campaign type, category and geo-tier.  
3. **Visualization**: Created charts to compare campaign performance, category spend and user activity.  
4. **Analysis**: Derived insights from campaign rankings and buyer behavior trends.

## Research Questions

- Which campaign type delivers the highest ROMI?  
- What is the cost efficiency across campaigns in terms of CPL and CAC?  
- How do different categories (influencer, social, etc.) perform relative to one another?  
- What patterns exist in buyer activity over time?  
- Are there significant differences in performance across geo-tiers?

## Process

1. Preprocessed campaign and customer activity data  
2. Calculated key performance metrics  
3. Visualized campaign-level and category-level performance  
4. Analyzed buyer activity across dates  
5. Identified correlations and gaps in campaign outcomes

## Insights

- **Top Campaign**: The **YouTube Blogger** campaign contributed the most revenue (₦15.3M).  
- **Best Category**: The **Influencer** category generated the highest ROMI (₦21.1M), followed by **Social** (₦11.9M).  
- **Cost Efficiency**: The overall **CPC** is ₦10.20, **CPL** is ₦466.47 and **CAC** is ₦4K.  
- **Buyer Activity**: Buyer engagement is relatively consistent across weekdays and weekends, with slightly higher activity towards the end of the month.  
- **Geo-Tier Revenue**: Tier 1 campaigns yielded ₦7M in revenue with an equal ROMI, while Tier 2 brought in ₦4M.  
- **Campaign Types**: Influencer marketing outperformed all other campaign types in both revenue and ROMI.

## Key Findings

- Influencer campaigns deliver the highest marketing ROI and should be prioritized for future spend.  
- Social media campaigns also perform well and contribute significant revenue.  
- Search campaigns offer the lowest ROMI (₦3.7M) indicating potential inefficiencies or misalignment.  
- Geo segmentation reveals that Tier 1 regions are more profitable than Tier 2.  
- Weekends and month-end days show increased buyer activity suggesting better timing for campaign pushes.

## Conclusion

The Digital Marketing Performance Dashboard provides actionable insights that highlight top-performing campaigns and categories. It enables marketing teams to make data-informed decisions by clearly identifying where returns are maximized and where improvements are needed.
